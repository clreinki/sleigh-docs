# Sentry Logging (optional)
If you're looking for server event logging or performance data, Sleigh comes with built-in support for integration with [Sentry.io](https://sentry.io)

All you need to do is create your account on Sentry.io and put your sentry key in the SENTRY_DSN environment variable.

For additional information, please see the environment variable [reference table](/docs/deployment/reference.html)
